        <h2>wat?</h2>

        <p> <code class=ti>ti</code> is a simple (very slightly) command line
        time tracker. It is completely written in bash and has (almost)
        complete test coverage.  It is inspired by <a target=_blank
        href=http://adeel.github.com/timed/>timed</a>, which I felt a bit too
        limiting in features. It also takes inspirateion from the simplicity of
        <a target=_blank href=http://stevelosh.com/projects/t/>t</a>.</p>

        <p> If a time tracker tool makes me think for more than 10 seconds, I
        usually forget what I was concentrating on.  This is why I created
        <code class=ti>ti</code>.  With <code class=ti>ti</code>, you'll be
        only as fast as you can type, which you should be good with anyway.</p>

        <p>The most important part about <code class=ti>ti</code> is that it
        provides just a few commands to manage your time tracking and gets out
        of your way.  Better yet, its tiny core is extendable so you can write
        your own actions to make you even faster for stuff that <i>you</i>
        frequently do. In that spirit, all data is saved in an easily readable
        format by all humans, pythons, rubies and other pe<span
        style=color:#AAA>a</span>rls.</p>

        <p>Oh and by the way, the source is just a <a target=_blank
        href=https://bitbucket.org/sharat87/ti/src/tip/bin/ti>~150 lines bash
        script</a>, so if you know bash, I suggest you scim over it to get a
        better feel of how this works.</p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>

        <p>Here's the minimal usage style:</p>

        <pre class="usage hll">$ ti on my-project
Start working on my-project.

$ ti status
You have been working on my-project for less than a minute.

$ ti fin
So you stopped working on my-project.</pre>

        <p><code>on</code> and <code>fin</code> can take a time at which to
        apply the action</p>

        <pre class="usage hll">$ ti on another-project 2 hours ago
Start working on another-project.

$ ti st
You have been working on another-project for about 2 hours.

$ ti fin 30 minutes ago
So you stopped working on another-project.</pre>

        <p>Also illustrating in the previous example is any unambiguous prefix
        (<code>st</code>) of available actions can be used instead of the whole
        action name.</p>

        <p>Put brief notes on what you've been doing.</p>

        <pre class="usage hll">$ ti note waiting for Napoleon to take over the world
$ ti n another simple note for demo purposes</pre>

        <p>Tag your activities for fun and profit.</p>

        <pre class="usage hll">$ ti tag imp</pre>

        <p>Do plugins. For those that <i>need</i> the extra sauce.</p>

        <pre class="usage hll">$ cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; ~/.ti/greeter.ti.sh
&gt; action-greet () {
&gt;     echo Hello there awesome ti user!
&gt; }
&gt; EOF

$ ti greet # or just `ti gr`
Hello there awesome ti user!</pre>

        <p>That might not look like much, but with this simple exendability and
            using the API (docs coming soon, for now you'll have to check the
            source), you can create innovative actions. Stuff that analyse the
            time sheet and give a report, make a report of a week and mail that
            to yourself or your boss, simply echo the current project name so
            you can use it to show info in your terminal prompt, what not?</p>

        <h2>Status</h2>

        <p>The project is still in its infancy. I'd like for people to check it
            out and play with it.  Suggest more awesomeness and/or contribute
            otherwise.</p>

        <h2>Gimme!</h2>

        <p>You can get <code class=ti>ti</code> <a
                href=https://bitbucket.org/sharat87/ti>from the source on
                bitbucket</a>. Put the `ti`  bash script (located in the bin
            directory) somewhere in your $PATH and make sure it has executable
            permissions and you should be able to use it just fine.</p>

        <p>For the fancy relative time messages shown in the above usage
            examples, you'll need the <a
                href="https://bitbucket.org/sharat87/dtime"><code>dtime</code></a>
            executable somewhere in your $PATH (visit its page for more
            information).</p>

        <p>Please note that currently, the tests succeed only if the above
            mentioned dtime command is available. Otherwise, they fail. I'll
            fix this soon.</p>
